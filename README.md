# PlayableChess2
A playable version of the new chess rules by Oats Jenkins.
#
A youtuber by the name of Oats jenkins created some new rules for chess. So, I actually coded it! Rules explained here -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcivL8u176Y
# Compiling
I have the complete version of PlayableChess2 in the "Releases" Section. But if you want to check the code and make sure there are no viruses, or you want to modify some stuff in the engine, the source code is also in the "Releases" Section. HOWEVER, PLEASE DO NOT CHOOSE THE SOURCE CODE NAMED "Source Code". CHOOSE THE "Compilable/Modifiable Source Code". It might not work if you choose the other. The compiling tutorial can be found here ->
